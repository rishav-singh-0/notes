## Introduction
- Pipelining overlaps execution of instructions
Exploits Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP)

- There are two main approaches:
  - Compiler-based static approaches
  - Hardware-based dynamic approaches
- Exploiting ILP is to minimize CPI
  - Pipeline CPI = Ideal (base) CPI + Structural stalls + Data hazard stalls +
    Control stalls

## Parallelism limitation within Basic Block
- The basic block- a straight-line code sequence without branches in except to
  the entry and no branches out except at the exit.
- Parallelism with basic block is limited. Typical size of basic block few
  instructions only. Must optimize across multiple blocks (branches)

## Data Dependence
- Loop-Level Parallelism
  - Unroll loop statically or dynamically
- Challenges—> Data dependency
- Data dependence conveys possibility of a hazard
- Dependent instructions cannot be executed simultaneously
- Pipeline determines if dependence is detected and if it causes a stall or not
- Data dependence conveys upper bound on exploitable instruction level
  parallelism

## Name Dependence & Output dependence
- Two instructions use the same name but no flow of information.
- Not a true data dependence, but is a problem when reordering instructions
- **Antidependence:** instruction j writes a register or memory location that instruction i reads
  - Initial ordering (i before j) must be preserved
- **Output dependence:** instruction i and instruction j write the same register or memory location
  - Ordering must be preserved
- To solve, use register renaming techniques

## Control Dependence
- Ordering of instruction with respect to a branch instruction
  - Instruction that is control dependent on a branch cannot be moved **before**
    the branch so that its execution is no longer controller by the branch
  - An instruction that is not control dependent on a branch cannot be moved
    **after** the branch so that its execution is controlled by the branch.
    ```
    if p1 {S1;};
    if p2 {S2;};
    ```
- Instruction that is control dependent on a branch cannot be moved **before** the
  branch so that its execution is no longer controller by the branch
- An instruction that is not control dependent on a branch cannot be moved
  **after** the branch so that its execution is controlled by the branch.

## Compiler Techniques for Exposing ILP
- Find and overlap sequence of unrelated instruction 
- Pipeline scheduling
  - Separate dependent instruction from the source instruction by pipeline
    latency of the source instruction
  ```
  Example:
  for (i=999; i>=0; i=i-1)
    x[i] = X[i] +s;
  ```

MIPS Assembly code for above code:
```
loop:
  L.D F0,0(R1)
  stall
  ADD.D F4,F0,F2
  stall
  stall
  S.D F4,0(R1)
  DADDUI R1,R1,#-8
  stall (assume integer load latency is 1)
  BNE R1,R2,Loop
```
Scheduled Code:
```
loop:
  L.D FO,0(R1)
  DADDUI R1,R1,#-8
  ADD.D F4,F0,F2
  stall
  stall
  S.D F4,8(R1)
  BNE R1.R2.Loop
```

## Loop Unrolling

## Loop Unrolling / Pipeline Scheduling
![loop unrollung](./images/loop-unrollung-scheduling.png) 

## Strip Mining
- Unknown number of loop iterations?
  - Goal: make k copies of the loop body Number of iterations = n
  - Generate pair of loops:
    - First executes n mod k times
    - Second executes n / k times
    - Strip mining
  - Example: Let n=35, k=4
    - Loop 1 execute 3 times
    - Loop 2 execute 8 times by unrolling 4 copies per iteration
  
## Steps in Loop Unrolling and Scheduling
- Determine that unrolling the loop would be useful.
- Identify independency of loop iterations.
- Use different registers to avoid unnecessary constraints put in on same
  computations.
- Eliminate the extra test and branch instructions and adjust the loop
  termination and iteration code.
- Determine whether the loads and stores from different iterations are
  independent.
- Schedule the code, preserving any dependences needed to yield the same result
  as the original code.

## Loop Unrolling & Pipeline Scheduling
- Limitations of loop unrolling:
  - Code size limitations — I-cache miss
  - Compiler limitations — register pressure

# Dynamic Scheduling
- Rearrange execution order of instructions to reduce stalls while maintaining data flow.
- Advantages
  - Compiler doesn't need to have knowledge of micro-architecture
  - Handles cases where dependencies are unknown at compile time
  ```
  str R2, 8(R1)
  ld R3, 16(R4)
  // will access same location if 8+[R1] == 16+[R4]
  ```
- Disadvantages
  - Substantial increase in hardware complexity
  - Complicates exceptions

## How dynamic scheduling works?
- Limitation of simple pipelining.
  - In-order instruction issue and execution.
  - Instructions are issued in program order.
  - If an instruction is stalled in the pipeline, no later instructions can
  proceed.

  ```
  add rl,r2,r3
  sub r4,rl,xr3
  and r6,rl,r7
  or r8,rl,r9
  ```
- Limitation of simple pipelining.
  - In-order instruction issue and execution.
  - Instructions are issued in program order.
  - If an instruction is stalled in the pipeline, no later instructions can
    proceed.

- If instruction j depends on a long-running instruction i, currently in
  execution in the pipeline, then all instructions after j must be stalled
  until i is finished and j can execute.

  ```
  DIV.D FO,F2,F4
  ADD.D F10,FO,F8
  SUB.D F12.F8,F14
  ```
- Separate the issue process into two parts:
  - checking for any structural hazards.
  - waiting for the absence of a data hazard
- Use in-order instruction issue but we want an instruction to begin execution
  as soon as its data operands are available.
- out-of-order execution - out-of-order completion.
- OOO execution introduces the possibility of WAR and WAW hazards

```
DIV.D FO,F2,F4      // can have divide by zero exception
ADD.D F6,FO0,F8
SUB.D F8,F10,F14    // already completed before div instruction
MUL.D F6,F10,F8
```

- WAR and WAW hazards — solved by register renaming
- Possibility of imprecise exception (2 possibilities).
  - The pipeline may have already completed instructions that are later in
    program order than the instruction causing the exception.
  - The pipeline may have not yet completed some instructions that are earlier
    in program order than the instruction causing the exception

- To allow out-of-order execution, split the ID stage into two
  - Issue-Decode instructions, check for structural hazards.
  - Read operands-Wait until no data hazards, then read operands.
- In a dynamically scheduled pipeline, all instructions pass through the issue
  stage in order (in-order issue); however, they can be stalled or bypass each
  other in the second stage (read operands) and thus enter execution out of
  order.
- Done by - score boarding technique
- Approach used - Tomasulo’s algorithm

## Register Renaming

![Register Renaming](./images/register-renaming.png) 

- Register renaming is done by reservation stations (RS)
- Each RS Contains:
  - The instruction (operation to be done)
  - Buffered operand values (when available)
  - Reservation station number of instruction providing the operand values
- RS fetches and buffers an operand as soon as it becomes available (not
  necessarily involving register file)
- Pending instructions designate the RS that will provide input
- Result values broadcast on common data bus (CDB)

## Tomasulo's Algorithm
- Load and store buffers contain data and addresses.
- They also act as RS

### Issue 
- Get next instruction from FIFO queue
- If RS available, issue the instruction to the RS with operand values if
  available
- If operand values not available, stall the instruction

### Execute
- When operand becomes available, store it in any reservation stations waiting
  for it
- When all operands are ready, execute the instruction
- Loads and store uses buffers
- No instruction will initiate execution until all branches that precede it in
  program order have completed

### Write result
- Write result into CDB (there by it reaches the reservation station, store
  buffer and registers file) with name of execution unit that generated the
  result.
- Stores must wait until address and value are received
