## Static Keyword
Static variables have a property of preserving their value even after they are out of their scope!
The purpose of these is to limit scope of a variable or function to a file

## Declaration
- Declaration of a variable or function simply declares that the variable or function exists somewhere in the program, but the memory is not allocated for them.
- It tells the program what its type is going to be. In case of function declarations, it also tells the program the arguments, their data types, the order of those arguments, and the return type of the function.

## Defination
- When we define a variable or function, in addition to everything that a declaration does, it also allocates memory for that variable or function.
