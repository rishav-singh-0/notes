# Storage Classes
Date: 11th Jan 2023

## auto
This is the default storage class for all the variables declared inside a function or a block.

## extern
Extern storage class simply tells us that the variable is defined elsewhere and not within the same block where it is used.

- Extends the visibility of the variables/functions
- Extern variable says to compiler "go outside my scope and you will find the definition of the variable that I declared."
- Compiler believes that whatever that extern variable said is true and produce no error. Linker throws an error when it finds no such variable exists.
- When an extern variable is initialized, then memory for this is allocated and it will be considered defined.

- When a function is declared or defined, the extern keyword is implicitly assumed since functions are visible throughout the program by default.
- As an exception, when an extern variable is declared with initialization, it is taken as the definition of the variable as well.

## static
Static variables have the property of preserving their value even after they are out of their scope. They are initialized only once and exist till the termination of the program. Their scope is local to the function to which they were defined. Global static variables can be accessed anywhere in the program. By default, they are assigned the value 0 by the compiler. 

- Static variables are allocated memory in data segment, not stack segment. 
- Default value is 0. For pointers it is NULL pointer.
- In C, static variables can only be initialized using constant literals(Not true in C++). All objects with static storage duration must be initialized (set to their initial values) before execution of main() starts. So a value which is not known at translation time cannot be used for initialization of static variables.
- Static variables should not be declared inside structure. All structure members should reside in the same memory segment because the value for the structure element is fetched by counting the offset of the element from the beginning address of the structure.


## register
Functionality is same as `auto` but the only difference is that the compiler tries to store these variables in the register of the microprocessor if a free registration is available. If a free registration is not available, these are then stored in the memory only. We cannot obtain the address of a register variable using pointers. 
- The keyword register hints(request) to compiler that a given variable can be put in a register. It’s compiler’s choice to put it in a register or not.
- Register is a storage class, and C doesn’t allow multiple storage class specifiers for a variable. So, register can not be used with static.
- Register can only be used within a block (local), it can not be used in the global scope (outside main).
- There is no limit on number of register variables in a C program, but the point is compiler may put some variables in register and some not.

## volatile qualifier 
- The volatile keyword is intended to prevent the compiler from applying any optimizations on objects that can change in ways that cannot be determined by the compiler. 
- An object that has volatile-qualified type may be modified in ways unknown to the implementation or have other unknown side effects.
- A volatile declaration may be used to describe an object corresponding to a memory-mapped input/output port or an object accessed by an asynchronously interrupting function. Actions on objects so declared shall not be "optimized out" by an implementation or reordered except as permitted by the rules for evaluating expressions.
- Too many `volatile` variables in your program would also result in lesser & lesser compiler optimization. 
- The system always reads the current value of a volatile object from the memory location rather than keeping its value in a temporary register at the point it is requested, even if a previous instruction asked for the value from the same object.

## const quantifier
- The qualifier const can be applied to the declaration of any variable to specify that its value will not be changed ( Which depends upon where const variables are stored, we may change the value of const variable by using pointer ). The result is implementation-defined if an attempt is made to change a const. 

```
int a = 5, b = 10, c = 15;

const int* foo;     // pointer to constant int.
foo = &a;           // assignment to where foo points to.

/* dummy statement*/
*foo = 6;           // the value of a can´t get changed through the pointer.

foo = &b;           // the pointer foo can be changed.



int *const bar = &c;  // constant pointer to int 
                      // note, you actually need to set the pointer 
                      // here because you can't change it later ;)

*bar = 16;            // the value of c can be changed through the pointer.    

/* dummy statement*/
bar = &a;             // not possible because bar is a constant pointer.  
```
